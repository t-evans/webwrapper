# webwrapper
This is a simple iOS app shell that is designed to wrap multiple mobile web sites.  There is a slide-out menu with links for navigating between each website.  It can also be configured to cache the contents of each website for offline viewing.

See settings.plist for examples of how to use/configure the app.  Basically, you can create one or 
more "Navigation Items", which will appear in the sidebar list.  Each of those can point to a 
static URL, or a dynamic URL that is pulled from the App settings (if you include a Settings.bundle
with your project).

See my other jockeyjs-alerts project (https://github.com/t-evans/jockeyjs-alerts) for a javascript 
library that can send native-style alerts to this app.  It makes use of my fork of Tim Coulter's 
JockeyJS lib (https://github.com/tcoulter/jockeyjs) for communication to/from the web sites
that are loaded into this app.

I'm not currently doing any further development on this project, as it meets my needs, as is.
