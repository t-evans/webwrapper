# webwrapper
A simple iOS app shell that is designed to wrap multiple mobile web sites.  There is a slide-out menu with links for navigating between each website.  It can also be configured to cache the contents of each website for offline viewing.

<br>
See my other jockeyjs-alerts project (https://github.com/t-evans/jockeyjs-alerts) for a javascript 
library that can send native-style alerts to this up.  It makes use of my fork of Tim Coulter's 
JockeyJS lib (https://github.com/tcoulter/jockeyjs) for communication to/from the web sites
that are loaded into this app.

<br>
I'm not currently doing any further development on this project, as it meets my needs, as is.
